Implementation description:

Pac-Man is an arcade game that started in the 1980s, making it one of the most popular games ever. In our game it is possible to identify some changes from the original game. In the original game it is not possible to win the game, while in our game it is possible to win if the player gets 100000 points. However, the player continues to establish his high-score.

Otherwise, all behaviors are the same as in the initial game. 

The player has 3 lives, losing one each time he touches a ghost. Upon dying, it respawns in its initial position, which can be considered a safe house since, with the vertical and horizontal movement of the ghosts, they are not able to enter that space.

Game Instructions:
Movement:
Left arrow - Left movement.

Right arrow - Movement to the right.

Down arrow - Down movement.

Up Arrow - Up Movement.

Bonus Balls - Each large ball leaves enemies vulnerable until Pac-Man kills one, earning 400 points for doing so.
